Guide
=====

Step 1:
-------

Figure out what is wrong. Login to the F5 with your web browser to see
what was configured.

1. Click on ``ServiceMain`` to see why its down.
2. Look at the ``Availability`` field in the table.

3. Click on the ``Pools`` under ``Local Traffic``
4. Click on ``app_pool``
5. Click on the ``Members`` button

.. figure:: 443.png
   :alt: 443

   443

The port **443** is incorrect. The two RHEL web servers are only running
on port 80. This is why they are showing down.

Step 2:
-------

Using your text editor of choice open the existing jinja template
``as3_template.j2``:

..

   ``vim`` and ``nano`` are available on the control node. 
   The Ansible node is equiped with ``Visual Studio Code`` and can be accessed via UDF ACCESS Methods.

Step 3:
-------

Find where the port **443** is and modify it to port **80**.

The line looks as follows->

.. code-block:: jinja

                   "servicePort": 443,

change it to->

.. code-block:: jinja

                   "servicePort": 80,

Step 4
------

Run the playbook - exit back into the command line of the control host
and execute the following:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   [centos@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook as3.yml

Playbook Output
===============

The output will look as follows.

.. code-block:: shell-session

   [centos@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook as3.yml

   PLAY [Linklight AS3] ***********************************************************

   TASK [Create AS3 JSON Body] ****************************************************
   ok: [f5]

   TASK [Push AS3] ****************************************************************
   ok: [f5 -> localhost]

   PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
   f5                         : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0

Verifying the Solution
======================

Login to the F5 with your web browser to see what was configured. Grab
the IP information for the F5 load balancer from the lab_inventory/hosts
file, and type it in like so: https://X.X.X.X:8443/

   f5 gui as3

1. Click on the Local Traffic on the lefthand menu
2. Click on Virtual Servers.
3. On the top right, click on the drop down menu titled ``Partition``
   and select WorkshopExample
4. The Virtual Server ``serviceMain`` will be displayed.
5. This time it will be Green
   (``Available (Enabled) - The virtual server is available``)
6. Verify under ``Pools`` for ``app_pool`` that both web servers are set
   to port **80** for their ``service_port``

.. note::
   In your environment, go to the f5 component and use the
   ``HTTP Virtual Server Test`` access method to test.
