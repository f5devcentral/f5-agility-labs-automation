You can use the **terminal Pane** to launch **Ansible playbooks** and execute **Shell** commands during the lab.

Step 5
------
In order to be able to deploy those Ansible playbooks, you need to create YAML scripts which will become your ansible-playbooks.
In **VS Code Explorer** and ``right-click`` and select **New File**. |new_file|

   Note: Make sure you right-click in the 'empty' grey area. When you right-click at the height of the folder section and create a new file, that file will end up in that selected folder.
