Telemetry Streaming With Kibana
-----------------------------------

In this lab we will configure our Telemetry Streaming JSON declaration to establish a connection between our Kibana consumer and our BIG-IP. 

------------------------------------------------ 

**Exercise 1 - Configure Kibana as the Telemetry Consumer**

#. Open Postman.

#. Open the collection `Create ELK Consumer`. 

#. Click the `ELK Consumer` request.

#. Click on the Body tab. 

    .. image:: ./elkbody.jpg

#. Send the POST request by clicking the blue 'Send' button. Ensure a 'Status: 200 OK' response.  

    .. image:: ./elkresponse.jpg

**HINT** Here is what is important from this declaration: 

   * The Listener collects event logs from all BIG-IP sources, including LTM, ASM, AFM, APM, and AVR. You can configure all of these by POSTing a single AS3 declaration or you can use TMSH or the GUI to configure individual modules.  

   * The Consumer class is the third party consumer we wish to send our captured data to. 

**NOTE:** By sending this GET request to ``https://10.1.1.9/mgmt/shared/telemetry/declare`` with the correct credentials and current body we've established a connection between our consumer and our BIG-IP. 

**NOTE:** Additionally, you should see a Read Only collection in Postman.  These API calls are necessary to configure the Elastic database and provide a mapping of indexes between the BigIP and Elastic.  You do not need to send these commands as the ELK environment is already pre-configured.

------------------------------------------------ 

**Exercise 2 - Generate Traffic on OpenCart**
  
#. From the UDF page, find the host named Traffic Gen and select Web Shell from the dropdown 

#. Type su for sudo user access. If prompted, the password is toor.  

#. Change director to /home/ec2-user

#. Run ./baseline_menu.sh

#. From the menu, choose 2) Alternate and let it run while you continue with the labs 

------------------------------------------------ 


**Exercise 3 - Analyze Telemetry via Kibana**

#. Back in the Windows RDP session, open a new tab in Chrome and click the Kibana bookmark.

#. Select the Discover tab on the top left.

#. Ensure that `f5` is selected in the dropdown and that a reasonable time range is selected in the top right (ie 15 minutes in the screenshot below).

    .. image:: ./f5selected.jpg

#. Now you should see some logs coming in. 

------------------------------------------------ 

**Exercise 4 - Create a Simple Kibana Visualization**

#. In Discover, type ``data.http_code \: 40*``. This will show you all HTTP resonses starting with 40. Press the blue Refresh to apply.

    .. image:: ./kib_1.png

#. Click the Visualize tab on the left and click Create a Visualization

#. You can explore various types of graphs. For this exercise we will select the Line graph

#. Under Select Index select f5\*

#. On the left, under Buckets select X-Axis. Select Date Histogram from the Aggregation dropdown, data.event_timestamp from the Field dropdown, and Auto from the Interval dropdown.

    .. image:: ./kib_2.png

#. Now select the Apply Changes play button next to Panel Settings. Press the blue Refresh button on the top right. View your visualization.
