   .. code-block:: sql
    
      fields @timestamp, @message, system.hostname, system.cpu, system.tmmCpu
         | stats avg(system.cpu) as SystemCpu, avg(system.tmmCpu) as TmmCpu by bin(5m), system.hostname

   .. code-block:: sql

      fields @timestamp, @message, system.hostname
         | parse @message "clientSideTraffic.bitsIn\":*," as clientsin
         | parse @message "clientSideTraffic.bitsOut\":*," as clientsout

#. Paste the code blocks in and click Run Query
