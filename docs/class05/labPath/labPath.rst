Lab Pathways
============

.. Warning:: Please wait for the instructors instruction on the pathways.

This lab has ``two`` pathways to completion.

  - **Postman Deployment**
  - **Ansible Tower Deployment**

The Postman Deployment is designed as a transition pathway from iControlRest native imperative calls. During this path, the student will utilize Postman to become more familiar with the process of interacting with a BIG-IP declaratively.

The Ansible Tower Deployment is highly advanced and requires a level of understanding of how CI and declarative tools operate. Most configuration is abstracted from the student. The student is encouraged to spend the extra time looking at the operations at a granular level for better understanding.
 

.. Note:: No matter the path chosen in the lab, all students have the same result.
