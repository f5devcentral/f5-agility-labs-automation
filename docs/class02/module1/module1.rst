Module 1: Programmability - Introduction to F5 Declarative Onboarding Concepts
===============================================================================

The purpose of this module is to introduce the concepts of F5 Declarative
Onboarding.  Declarative Onboarding is part of the F5 Automation Toolchain. F5
Declarative onboarding uses a declarative model to initially configure a BIG-IP
device with all of the required settings to get up and running. This includes
system settings such as licensing and provisioning, network settings such as
VLANs and Self IPs, and clustering settings if you are using more than one
BIG-IP system.

.. note::
   Students should have a basic understanding of BIG-IP
   technologies and a desire to learn about automation and orchestration.
