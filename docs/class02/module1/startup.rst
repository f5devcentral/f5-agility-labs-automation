Using browser to connect to BIGIP UI
------------------------------------

When using Firefox to connect to the F5 appliances you will receive certificate
warnings as we are using self signed certs in this lab.

Bypass any security warning you may receive by clicking ``Advanced`` in the
browser, then clicking ``Accept the Risk and Continue``
